# Spinning Donut in Computer Craft
Based on https://github.com/Zeyu-Li/spinning-donuts/blob/master/donut.lua \
which is based on https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html \
Minifier I used: https://goonlinetools.com/lua-minifier/
# Usage
*The Donut is too thick this is why you need a monitor* \
if you downloaded it
```
monitor <name> donut
```
or from pastebin
```
monitor <name> pastebin run rVCE5UZX
```
